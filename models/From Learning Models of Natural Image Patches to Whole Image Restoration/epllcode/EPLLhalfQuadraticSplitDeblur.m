%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% EPLLhalfQuadraticSplitDeblur - Minimizes the EPLL cost using half quadratic splitting
% as defined in the paper:
% "From Learning Models of Natural Image Patches to Whole Image Restoration"
% by Daniel Zoran and Yair Weiss, ICCV 2011
% 
% 
% Version 1.0 (21/10/2011)
%
% This function is for deblurring, for denoising and inpainting - for deblurring refer to
% EPLLhalfQuadraticSplit.m
%
%
% Inputs:
%
%   noiseI - the blurry image, with some noise added to it
%   lambda - the parameter lambda from Equation (2) in the paper (mostly
%            used as the inverse of the noise variance. If a matrix is given, it
%            should be the same size as the image (used for inpainting)
%   K - the blur kernel used to blur the image
%   patchSize - the size of patches to extract (single scalar, patches are
%               always square)
%   betas - a list (1xM vector) of beta values, if the values are positive, they will be
%           used as is, negative values will be ignored and beta will be estimated
%           automatically from the noisy image (for as many iterations as there are
%           in betas)
%   T - The number of iterations to optimizie for X and Z at each beta
%       value
%   prior - a function handle to a function which calculates a MAP estimate
%           using a given prior for a noisy patch at noise level beta, see examples in the
%           demos
%   I - the original image I, used only for PSNR calculations and
%       comparisons
%   LogLFunc - a function handle to calculate the log likelihood of patches
%              in the image, used for calculating the total cost (optional).
%
%
%
% Outputs:
%
%   cleanI - the restored image
%   psnr - a list of the psnr values obtained for each beta and iteration
%   cost - if LogLFunc is given then this is the cost from Equation 2 in
%          the paper at each value of beta.
%
% See demos in this same code package for examples on how to use this
% function for deblurring some example priors
% (including the GMM prior used in the paper).
